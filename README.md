Completion Instructions

Functionality to be added

The app must have the following functionalities

Initially, the number displayed should be 0

When Generate button is clicked, a random number should be generated in the range of 0 to 100 and displayed

Implementation Files

Use these files to complete the implementation:

src/components/RandomNumberGenerator/index.js

Quick Tips

Click to view

You can use Math.random() function to get a random number (float value) in range 0 to less than 1 (0 <= randomNumber < 1)

 Math.random()

 You can use Math.ceil() function to round a number up to the next largest integer

 console.log(Math.ceil(95.906698007537561)); // 96

 You can use the box-shadow CSS property to apply the box-shadow effect to containers

  box-shadow: 0px 4px 16px 0px

Things to Keep in Mind

All components you implement should go in the src/components directory.

Don't change the component folder names as those are the files being imported into the tests.

Do not remove the pre-filled code
